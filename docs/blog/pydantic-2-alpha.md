We're excited to announce the first alpha release of Pydantic 2!

This first Pydantic 2 alpha is no April Fool's joke. After months of work, we invite you to explore the improvements we've made and give us your feedback. We look forward to hearing your thoughts and working together to improve the library.

For many of you, Pydantic is already a key part of your Python toolkit and needs no introduction &mdash; we hope you'll find the improvements and additions in Pydantic 2 useful.

If you're new to Pydantic: Pydantic is an open-source Python library that provides powerful data parsing and validation &mdash; including type coercion and useful error messages when typing issues arise &mdash; and settings management capabilities. See [the docs](/) for examples of Pydantic at work.

## Getting started with the Pydantic 2 alpha

Your feedback will be a critical part of ensuring that we have made the right tradeoffs with the API changes in v2.

To get started with the Pydantic 2 alpha, install it from PyPI. We recommend using a virtual environment to isolate your testing environment:

```bash
pip install --pre -U "pydantic>=2.0"
```

Note that there are still some rough edges and incomplete features, and while trying out the Pydantic 2 alpha releases you may experience errors. We encourage you to try out the alpha releases in a test environment and not in production. Some features are still in development, and we will continue to make changes to the API.

If you do encounter any issues, please [create an issue in GitHub](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues) using the `bug V2` label. This will help us to actively monitor and track errors, and to continue to improve the libraryâ€™s performance.

This will be the first of several upcoming alpha releases. As you evaluate our changes and enhancements, we encourage you to share your feedback with us.

Please let us know:

- If you don't like the changes, so we can make sure pydantic remains a library you enjoy using.
- If this breaks your usage of pydantic so we can fix it, or at least describe a migration path.

Thank you for your support, and we look forward to your feedback.
